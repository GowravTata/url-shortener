# Prerequisites

Install the following tools before starting.

| Tool | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| Git | Clone repository |
| Docker | Run containers |
| Docker Compose | Service orchestration |
| Terraform | Infrastructure provisioning |
| AWS Account | Deploy infrastructure |

Verify installations

```bash
git --version

docker --version

docker compose version

terraform version
```

---

# Quick Start

Follow these steps to provision the infrastructure and deploy the application.

## Before You Begin

- Install the following tools:
  - Git
  - Terraform
  - Docker (for local development)
- Create an AWS account with the required permissions.
- Generate an SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f my-ec2-key
```

- Copy the generated public key (`my-ec2-key.pub`) to:

```text
terraform/my-ec2-key.pub
```

- Configure your public IP address for SSH access by either:
  - Updating the `my_ip` variable in `terraform/variables.tf`, **or**
  - Passing it during deployment:

```bash
terraform apply -var="my_ip=<YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>" 
```

---

## Deploy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GowravTata/url-shortener.git

cd url-shortener/terraform

terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply
```

Terraform automatically:

- Provisions the AWS infrastructure.
- Configures the EC2 instance.
- Deploys the application using the EC2 bootstrap script.
- Starts all required Docker containers.

Once the deployment is complete, Terraform outputs the EC2 Public IP.

---

## Verify Deployment

Open Swagger UI:

```text
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/docs
```

Open Kafka UI:

```text
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
```

---

## Load Demo Data

Populate the application with sample users, URLs, and click events.

```bash
curl -X POST \
"http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/v1/admin/seed/all"
```

The application is now ready for testing.


# AWS Permissions

For development purposes, the IAM user executing Terraform should have:

```

AmazonEC2FullAccess

```

This keeps the setup simple.

For production environments, replace this with a least-privilege IAM policy.

---


The application deployment is covered in the next section.
# Application Deployment

After connecting to the EC2 instance, clone the application repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/url-shortener.git

cd url-shortener
```

---
# Verify Deployment

Terraform deploys the application automatically using the EC2 bootstrap script.

After `terraform apply` completes, wait a few minutes for the bootstrap process to finish.

Verify that the application is available by opening:

| Service | URL |
|----------|-----|
| Application | http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000 |
| Swagger UI | http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/docs |
| OpenAPI | http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/openapi.json |
| Kafka UI | http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080 |
| PgAdmin (if enabled) | http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:5050 |

If these pages load successfully, the deployment has completed successfully.

## Verify Running Containers

If you suspect the deployment failed, connect to the EC2 instance and verify that the containers are running.

List all running containers.

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected containers include:

```text
url-shortener-api
postgres
redis
kafka
kafka-ui
analytics-consumer
```

If a container is not running, inspect the logs.

```bash
docker compose logs
```

To continuously monitor the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```


---

# Verify Application

Open Swagger UI.

```text
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/docs
```

OpenAPI Specification

```text
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/openapi.json
```

Application Root

```text
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000
```

If Swagger loads successfully, the application is running correctly.

---

# Seed Demo Data

The project includes Admin Seed APIs for generating realistic demo data.

These APIs create:

- Test Users
- Shortened URLs
- Click Events

The APIs are intentionally separated so that each step can be executed independently.

---

## Create Users

```http
POST /v1/admin/seed/users
```

Example

```bash
curl -X POST \
"http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/v1/admin/seed/users?count=100"
```

Maximum users allowed:

```text
100
```

---

## Create URLs

> Users must exist before URLs can be created.

```http
POST /v1/admin/seed/urls
```

Example

```bash
curl -X POST \
"http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/v1/admin/seed/urls?count=1000"
```

Maximum URLs allowed:

```text
1000
```

---

## Generate Clicks

> URLs must exist before clicks can be generated.

```http
POST /v1/admin/seed/clicks
```

Example

```bash
curl -X POST \
"http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/v1/admin/seed/clicks?count=1000"
```

Maximum clicks allowed:

```text
1000
```

---

## Seed Everything

Creates users, URLs, and click events in the correct order.

```http
POST /v1/admin/seed/all
```

Example

```bash
curl -X POST \
"http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/v1/admin/seed/all"
```

Default execution:

- 100 Users
- 1000 URLs
- 1000 Click Events

The endpoint internally performs:

```text
Create Users
      ↓
Create URLs
      ↓
Generate Clicks
```

This is the recommended endpoint for populating a fresh environment.

# Kafka UI

Kafka UI provides a graphical interface for monitoring Kafka topics and consumers.

Open:

```text
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
```

You can:

- View Topics
- Browse Messages
- Monitor Consumer Groups
- Inspect Offsets
- Verify Event Processing

---

# Verify Event Flow

After seeding data:

1. Open Swagger.
2. Access any generated short URL.
3. The application redirects immediately.
4. A click event is published to Kafka.
5. Analytics Consumer processes the event.
6. Click count is updated asynchronously.

Open Kafka UI to observe the messages in real time.

---

# Redis

Redis is used as a cache for frequently accessed URLs.

Benefits include:

- Faster redirects
- Reduced PostgreSQL queries
- Improved application performance

Redis runs automatically through Docker Compose.

To inspect Redis logs:

```bash
docker compose logs redis
```

---

# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL stores:

- Users
- Short URLs
- Click Analytics
- URL Metadata

To connect directly:

```bash
docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres
```

List databases:

```sql
\l
```

Connect to the application database:

```sql
\c url_shortener
```

List tables:

```sql
\dt
```

---

# REST API Overview

The application exposes REST APIs for authentication, URL management, analytics, and administration.

Interactive API documentation is available through Swagger.

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/docs
```

OpenAPI Schema

```
http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/openapi.json
```

---

# Authentication APIs

## Register User

Creates a new user account.

**Endpoint**

```http
POST /v1/auth/register_user
```

Request

```json
{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "StrongPassword123"
}
```

Successful Response

```json
{
    "message": "User registered successfully."
}
```

---

## Login

Authenticates the user and returns a JWT access token.

**Endpoint**

```http
POST /v1/auth/login-json
```

Request

```json
{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "StrongPassword123"
}
```

Response

```json
{
    "access_token": "<jwt-token>",
    "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

---

# URL APIs

## Create Short URL

Creates a shortened URL for an authenticated user.

**Endpoint**

```http
POST /v1/urls
```

Headers

```text
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

Request

```json
{
    "original_url": "https://www.google.com"
}
```

Example Response

```json
{
    "short_code": "Ab12CD",
    "short_url": "http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8000/Ab12CD"
}
```

---

## Redirect

Redirects the user to the original URL.

**Endpoint**

```http
GET /{short_code}
```

Example

```http
GET /Ab12CD
```

Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://www.google.com
```

During every redirect the application

- Checks Redis cache
- Falls back to PostgreSQL if needed
- Updates Redis
- Publishes a Kafka event
- Redirects the user immediately

---

# Analytics APIs

Example endpoint

```http
GET /v1/analytics/{short_code}
```

Typical response

```json
{
    "short_code": "Ab12CD",
    "total_clicks": 150
}
```

---

# Rate Limiting

The application applies rate limiting to protect public APIs.

Benefits

- Prevents abuse
- Prevents excessive URL creation
- Protects backend services
- Demonstrates production-ready API design

### Infrastructure

Infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.

```bash
cd terraform

terraform init

terraform apply
```

---

### Application

Start everything using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

---

### Demo Data

Populate the database.

```bash
POST /v1/admin/seed/all
```

or

```bash
curl -X POST \
"http://<HOST>:8000/v1/admin/seed/all"
```

---

### Useful URLs

Swagger

```
http://<HOST>:8000/docs
```

Kafka UI

```
http://<HOST>:8080
```

Application

```
http://<HOST>:8000
```

---

### Common Issues

Docker Permission

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

newgrp docker
```

---

```bash
docker ps
```

---

Application Logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

---

Terraform Outputs

```bash
terraform output
```

---

Destroy Everything

```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

Rebuild Application

```bash
docker compose down
